# TheUltimateSoundPack TL:DR
  Cool sounds, loops, FST patcher instruments, and a giant drum kit for you to use in your musical Productions in FL:Studio.

#Some Notes
  It is advised to download the repository with github desktop or cmd prompt so updates are easily downloadable.
  Here's a rundown of what this repository is:
  Sounds free to use in music productions created by the contributers who upload to this repo.
  I will be continuously updating so remember if you decide to download from browser instead of github updates will not be easy.
  Please keep it organized. It's pretty obvious how to do so.
  Also make sure the sounds and melodies etc. you have the rights to use and give others the right to use them. Can't be from things like other drum packs.
  As an important note certain VST Plugins like Omnisphere don't allow you to use their samples even in a melody loop. Do not upload loops to this repo that you don't have the rights for.
  A good idea could be to use Stock FL plugins, and put effects on after.
  Finally, a thanks to everyone who ends up contributing.
